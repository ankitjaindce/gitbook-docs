# Aviator API

Aviator supports two callable APIs to query and mutate the state of resources within Aviator:
* [JSON API](reference/json-api.md)
* [GraphQL API](reference/graphql.md)

Additionally, [account webhooks](reference/webhooks.md) are supported. Webhooks are useful for integrating Aviator with other systems.
