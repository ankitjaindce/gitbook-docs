# Excluding reviewers

In a large organization, it may be desired to exclude certain reviewers from being suggested. These could be SREs, managers, product managers, designers or other inactive collaborators who may have access to the code base, and have contributed in the past but are passive collaborators now.&#x20;

The excluded reviewers are still accepted for approval check validation, but are never suggested by FlexReview.

To exclude the reviewers, enter their GitHub handles on the [<mark style="color:blue;">FlexReview config page</mark>](https://app.aviator.co/flexreview/config). Enter one username per line.
