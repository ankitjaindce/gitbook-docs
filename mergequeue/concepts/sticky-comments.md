# Sticky Comments

In addition to the dashboard, Aviator provides sticky comments to give you the status of a PR within GitHub.

Aviator posts a comment when a PR is opened, and will automatically update the comment as the PR moves through its lifecycle. This is a great way to stay up to date and identify any reasons that may have dequeued your PR or is preventing your PR from merging.

Having a sticky comment makes it easy for developers to find the status of the PR in one place, and also reduces noise if you set up notifications for new GitHub comments.
