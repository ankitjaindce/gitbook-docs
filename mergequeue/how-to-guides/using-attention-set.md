AttentionSet is a Pull Request review tracker that supports the natural back and forth communication during code review. 

AttentionSet records whose turn it is for all "open" state Pull Requests that Aviator manages. To see which Pull Requests are relevant to you as a specific user you must have created an Aviator account and linked it with GitHub's OAuth. 

To create an Aviator account, visit [the Aviator register page.](https://app.aviator.co/auth/register).

After creating an account, you will need to use OAuth to link your GitHub account. This can be done through the [integrations page](https://app.aviator.co/integrations/personal) under the personal tab.

You may also simply visit the [AttentionSet page](https://app.aviator.co/attentionset) without having a GitHub account linked. This will present the same OAuth prompt if an account is not found.
