# Webhooks

Your application can use webhooks to subscribe to events happening on your Aviator account.

When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI to choose which event actions will send you payloads. Only subscribing to the specific events you plan on handling limits the number of HTTP requests to your server. You can also subscribe to all current and future event actions. You can change the list of subscribed events anytime.

Each event corresponds to a certain set of actions that can happen on your organizationâ€™s repository. For example, if you subscribe to the merge failure event you'll receive detailed payloads every time a PR fails to merge.

### Payloads

Each webhook event payload also contains properties unique to the event. Most of the common properties are listed below.

### Actions

Below is the list of actions that can be configured in the MQ UI to receive webhook events.

| Name               | When it is triggered                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **opened**         | When the PR is opened.                                                                                                                                  |
| **labeled**        | When the Aviator trigger label was added to a PR.                                                                                                       |
| **queued**         | When the PR is queued. This typically happens when the PR is in an approved state and the Aviator trigger label is associated with the PR.              |
| **dequeued**       | When the Aviator label is manually removed from the PR. It is not reported in case of PR failing to merge.                                              |
| **top\_of\_queue** | When the PR reaches the top of the queue for processing.                                                                                                |

| **blocked**        | When the PR fails to merge and is blocked. The typical reason for failures can be retrieved from `status_code`, including CI failure or merge conflict. |
| **stuck**          | _(Parallel mode only)_ When a PR is stuck if the original PR is still running the checks after the specified timeout.                                   |
| **reset**          | _(Parallel mode only)_ When a parallel PR queue is reset.                                                                                               |
